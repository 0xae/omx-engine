# OMX Engine
Futures and Options trading engines.

omx is a research project to develop a next generation trading engine for options

and futures, which may or not incluid vanilla options.

The main objective is to build a centralized match-engine that uses a POS blockchain engine

like tendermint to do the settlement.

Decoupling the matching engine and the settlement infraestructure allows us to process thousands of tx per second

and at the same time provide unbreakable security upon settlement procedure.

The unsecure window is between the matching the orders and finalizing the settlement procedures, that is what this research is about.
