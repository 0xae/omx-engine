# OMX Engine
Futures and Options trading engines.

omx is a research project to develop a next generation trading engine for options
and futures, without much constraints on the specific flavors of these financial instruments.
The main objective is to build a centralized match-engine that uses a POS blockchain engine
like tendermint to do the settlement.

Decoupling the matching engine and the settlement infraestructure allows us to process thousands of tx per second
and at the same time provide unbreakable security upon the settlement procedure.
The unsecure window is between the matching the orders and finalizing the settlement procedures, that is what this research is about.

With that being said, we're to research the viability and challenges of using smart contracts
powered by bitcoin or ethereum blockchain to represent financial instruments of interest and how
can distributed, safe and sofisticated instruments be implemented in the modern era of cross 
border and interplanetary finance - blockchain.
